# Stock_Investment_Performance

In this project, I created a Python script to integrate my Google Spreadsheet data with the Yahoo Finance API, enabling automatic recording and updating of my portfolio's performance and details in the dashboard. By updating stock names, lot amounts, and average prices as needed, my script refreshes my investment performance and visualizations daily.

Here is the link for the dashboard: https://bit.ly/InvestmentPerformance_Dashboard

## Dataset
I use my own stock portofolio in this project to make it more relevan to a real case in Google Spreadsheet.
